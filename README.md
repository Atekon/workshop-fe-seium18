This is the Front End part of the application.

First of all, you need to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Atekon/workshop-fe-seium18.git
```

If you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed you can now
```
npm install
```
which will install all the required dependencies.

We will use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to generate a bundle/serve the application
